# Learning Bicep

Azure Bicep is a new declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources.
The ultimate goal and the reason for the Bicep project is an urgent need to make it easier to write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for the Azure platform.

Azure Bicep works as a transparent abstraction layer on top of Azure Resource Manager templates. Anything that can be done with ARM Templates can be done with Azure Bicep. With this abstraction, all the types, apiVersions, and properties valid within ARM Templates are also valid with Azure Bicep.

The Azure Bicep code is converted into an ARM Template. Then, the resulting ARM Template is used to deploy the Azure resources.
